            <h3>Payments</h3>
            <p>
              Dark Sky may offer the opportunity to purchase access to the Service
              by means of one-time or recurring payments (“Subscription”) through
              an authorized Marketplace Provider. These payments require you to
              have an active account with a Marketplace Provider and provide a
              then-current and valid method of payment, such as a credit card or
              debit card (a "Payment Method"). Payments will be processed by your
              respective Marketplace Provider and not through Dark Sky. Any
              inquiries related to payments should be directed to your Marketplace
              Provider. You are responsible for all charges incurred in connection
              with your payments.
            </p>
            <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
            <p>
              By selecting a Subscription, you agree to pay the Marketplace
              Provider a subscription fee on a designated cycle for the Service
              (the "Subscription Fee"). Subject to the Free Trials and Promotional
              Offers section below, the first Subscription Fee will be charged to
              your Payment Method on the date the Marketplace Provider confirms
              your Subscription purchase. Thereafter, the Subscription Fee and any
              applicable tax and service fees will be charged to your Payment
              Method by your Marketplace Provider on a recurring basis in
              accordance with your designated cycle.
            </p>
            <div className="subtext">
              <h5>Billing Cycle</h5>
              <p>
                The Subscription Fee will be billed at the time you establish your
                Subscription and on an ongoing, regular basis unless you cancel
                your Subscription. Please note that billing is processed by your
                Marketplace Provider and that billing cycles may vary. Note that
                the timing of your billing may change (i.e. in the event of a
                problem with your Payment Method, such as an expired credit card).
                You should confirm your Marketplace Provider's billing policies
                prior to establishing your Subscription.
              </p>

            <div className="subtext">
              <h5>Subscription Price Changes</h5>
              <p>
                Each Marketplace Provider reserves the right to change the price
                for a Subscription to the Service in its sole discretion and will
                be responsible for communicating any price changes to you in
                accordance with the law.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="subtext">
              <h5>Updating Payment Method</h5>
              <p>
                You may update your Payment Method with your Marketplace Provider
                at any time by accessing your account with such Marketplace
                Provider. If at any time the Marketplace Provider is unable to
                charge your Payment Method for the Subscription Fee due to
                insufficient funds, expired or invalid account details, or
                otherwise, you remain responsible for the cost of such
                Subscription Fee. A change in your Payment Method may result in
                changes to your prior billing cycle. It is your responsibility to
                update and maintain the Payment Method associated with your
                Subscription Fee. In the event your Payment Method is unable to
                cover the Subscription Fee, each of Marketplace Provider and Dark
                Sky reserve the right to suspend your respective accounts and
                access to the Service, until such time as the Payment Method has
                been updated to permit the Marketplace Provider to charge the
                Subscription Fee.

            <div className="subtext">
              <h5>Cancellation</h5>
              <p>
                You can cancel your Subscription at any time. Please note that you
                must cancel your Subscription before it renews for a subsequent
                term in order to avoid being charged for the next term’s
                Subscription Fee. If you cancel your Subscription, the
                cancellation will become effective at the end of the then-current
                term. You will need to cancel your Subscription directly with your
                Marketplace Provider.

            <div className="subtext">
              <h5>No Refunds</h5>
              <p>
                REFUNDS WILL NOT BE PROVIDED FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION. DARK SKY DOES
                NOT PROVIDE CREDIT, REFUNDS, OR PRORATED BILLING FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS
                THAT ARE CANCELLED MID-TERM. In such a circumstance, you will
                continue to have access to your Subscription until the end of the
                term’s billing cycle. Each Marketplace Provider reserves the right
                to offer refunds, discounts or other consideration in select
                circumstances at its sole discretion. Please note that each
                circumstance is unique and election to make such an offer in one
                instance does not create the obligation to do so in another.

            <h3>Free Trials and Promotional Offers</h3>
            <p>
              The Service may be made available to you on a free trial basis for a
              limited time ("Trial Subscription"). The specific duration of the
              Trial Subscription will be specified in the applicable offer at
              sign-up. Trial Subscriptions are limited to new Service subscribers,
              unless otherwise specified. Your status as a new subscriber to the

              Subscription, unless otherwise specified.
              <br />
              <br />
              At the time of signing up for a Trial Subscription, you must provide
              the Marketplace Provider with a valid Payment Method in order to use
              the Service during the Trial Subscription period. Your Payment
              Method will not be charged by the Marketplace Provider during the
              Trial Subscription Period, however a preauthorization may be used.
              <br />
              <br />
              UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION, THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE
              FOR THE SERVICE WILL BE CHARGED TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, UNLESS YOU
              TIMELY CANCEL THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL NOT
              BE NOTIFIED THAT YOUR TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION WILL END OR HAS ENDED.
              <br />
              <br />
              To find additional details about your Trial Subscription, including
              the date the Trial Subscription ends, please contact your
              Marketplace Provider directly.
              <br />
              <br />
              No refunds, adjustments or price protection will be applied to your
              Subscription Fee in the event of a new/subsequent discount or
              promotional offering after you sign-up for the Service. New
              customers may take advantage of any "new customer" promotion only
              once. Requirements for a special promotion will be stated at the
              time each offer is presented. As a condition of these Terms, you
              agree not to register multiple times for the same promotional offer
              using multiple names, addresses, email addresses or other means. Any
              such action shall constitute a violation of these Terms and may
              result in the termination of your account.

            <p>
              You shall indemnify and hold harmless Dark Sky from and against all

            <h3>General Provisions</h3>
            <p>
              These Terms of Use, and any other document expressly incorporated
              herein, set out the entire agreement between you and Dark Sky
              concerning the and they replace all earlier agreements and
              understandings between you and Dark Sky. If any part of these Terms
              of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable
              local laws or by an applicable court, that part shall be interpreted
              in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect as nearly as
              possible Dark Sky’s original intentions and the remainder of these
              Terms of Use shall remain valid and enforceable. Dark Sky’s failure
              to exercise or enforce any of its rights under these Terms of Use
              does not waive Dark Sky’s right to enforce such right. Any waiver of
              such rights shall only be effective if it is in writing and signed
              by Dark Sky.
            </p>

              regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of
